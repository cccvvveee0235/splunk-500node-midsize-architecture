Splunk Indexer Configuration Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide for the initial setup of a Splunk Indexer node: creating custom user accounts, enabling HTTPS, configuring data receiving ports, and managing index storage paths.

1. Creating Custom Accounts and Roles

Using the default admin account for daily operations is unsafe. Set up dedicated user accounts with restricted privileges based on necessary roles.

    In the Splunk Web interface, navigate to Settings -> Users (or Roles).

    Click New User, then enter the username and password.

    Assign appropriate roles (e.g., power, data_management_admin or a custom administrator role).

    Save the changes and verify login using the new account.
